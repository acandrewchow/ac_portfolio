                    Promotions can vary in complexity, depending on the actions
                    and steps that are required. As a result, this can cause
                    confusion to users which may drive them away from using the
                    feature. Similarly, customer service will receive a lot of
                    requests for a paticular promotion if the user has trouble
                    completing it.
